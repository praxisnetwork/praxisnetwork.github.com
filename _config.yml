title: The Praxis Network

# Program content

## Praxis Program
praxis-program:
  mission: 'To equip the next generation of knowledge workers for faculty positions and alternative academic careers at a moment when new questions can be asked and new systems built; additionally, to serve as the key node and nurturer of a broader "Praxis Network."'
  people: 'An annual cohort of six students from a variety of disciplines. Fellows receive mentoring and instruction from <a href="http://purdom.org/">Purdom Lindblad</a> and Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff.'
  research: 'The first and second cohort prototyped and expanded <a href="http://prism.scholarslab.org/">Prism</a>, a digital humanities tool for collective reading, or "crowdsourcing interpretation." The third cohort developed <a href="http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/">Ivanhoe</a>, a platform for critical, reflective interpretation. The current, fourth, cohort is expanding and revising Ivanhoe.'
  support: 'Initially supported through a two-year pilot period by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the program is now sustained by the University of Virginia Library, which also houses the <a href="http://scholarslab.org">Scholars’ Lab</a>.'
  directions: 'The curriculum will be adjusted continually, based on participant interest and the potential of various projects to make meaningful interventions in contemporary digital humanities discourse—which is construed as including both DH theory and praxis.'
  structure: 'This one-year funded fellowship features weekly meetings, a single, collaborative project common to all fellows and staff, and iterative, public sharing of outcomes and teaching materials.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'Keys for success include an investment of significant staff time for high-quality mentorship, adequate space for collaborative work, and flexibility to accommodate the various backgrounds and skill levels of the fellows.'

## CHI Initiative
chi-initiative:
  mission: 'To equip graduate and undergraduate students with the technical, creative, and practical skills necessary to apply information, communication, and computing technologies to cultural heritage materials and questions, influence the current state of cultural heritage informatics, and become thought leaders for the future of the field.'
  people: 'Directed by <a href="http://anthropology.msu.edu/blog/people/ethan-watrall/">Ethan Watrall</a>, the CHI Graduate Fellowship Program comprises a small cohort of graduate students from disciplines related to cultural heritage, while the CHI Fieldschool is open to graduate and undergraduate students, as well as existing professionals.'
  research: 'Fellows create innovative and vibrant digital projects that contribute new knowledge to their field of study, while also advancing the broader developments in cultural heritage informatics. Details about individual projects can be found on the <a href="http://chi.anthropology.msu.edu/blog/">CHI Initiative blog</a>.'
  support: 'Supported by internal funding from the MSU Graduate School, the College of Social Science, the Department of Anthropology, the Department of History, the Department of Writing, Rhetoric, and American Cultures, and University Outreach and Engagement.'
  directions: 'The program will be refined continually based on each year’s successes and challenges, as well as current best practices and development in the field, in order to create a sustainable and rigorous program in which fellows complete robust projects in their areas of interest.'
  structure: 'The two key programs are graduate fellowships, year-long funded opportunities to develop digital projects and skills; and fieldschool, a five-week theme-based immersive program for instruction and collaborative project development.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'Consider how to evaluate process-oriented work, and how the credits that students earn will counted by their departments. Also, keep in mind that certain disciplinary methods and paradigms may be unfamiliar for students.'

## Hope Mellon
hope-mellon-scholars:
  mission: 'To encourage scholarly collaboration among arts and humanities students and faculty; to strengthen engagement with digital humanities on the institutional level; to foster collaboration with other institutions; and to provide experiences and opportunities that will equip students for a variety of career options.'
  people: 'A highly selective undergraduate program directed by <a href="http://www.hope.edu/academic/english/about/facultyprofiles/pannapacker.htm">William Pannapacker</a>, the Mellon Scholars Program also involves faculty representatives from all departments in the Arts and Humanities division of the college.'
  research: 'Participating students have completed <a href="http://celebration.hope.edu/abstracts/listing_titles.asp?CELDEP_RID=1226">capstone projects</a> on a wide range of topics and presented them to the community, both within the institution and at broader conference settings. Future cohorts will have many options for the kinds of projects and research they undertake.'
  support: 'The program is currently funded by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, supplemented by internal funding to support faculty development.'
  directions: 'Signs of success would include: deeper faculty engagement with collaborative research and digital approaches; increasingly strong pool of applicants; a growing variety of high-quality projects and presentations; and successful placement of graduates in appropriate career paths.'
  structure: 'This six-course program includes a variety of modular options, including seminars, high-level courses with individual mentoring, collaborative digital projects, and individual capstone projects. Students are encouraged to present their work at conferences and online, to seek grant support for their work, and to connect their research with a variety of career paths.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'Faculty investment is among the most important factors for success, and helps ensure a successful student experience as well as institutional support. Other important variables are demonstrated success of projects and effective career development.'

## CUNY GCDI
cuny-gcdi:
  mission: 'To develop and highlight a broad range of digital projects and resources at the CUNY Graduate Center, and to foster institutional change at the Graduate Center by heightening the public presence of its digital initiatives.'
  people: 'Directed by <a href="http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/members/admin/">Matthew K. Gold</a> under the purview of the Provost’s Office, the first cohort of digital fellows are doctoral students from a variety of backgrounds.'
  research: 'While the program is still in the early stages of development, the first cohort of fellows are leading a <a href="http://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/projects/">variety of innovative projects</a> to advance the digital initiatives of the Graduate Center.'
  support: 'Financial support for the program is completely internal to the Provost’s Office, which signals a strong institutional commitment.'
  directions: 'This new program is experimental, so many successes and challenges are anticipated. One hope is to retain some students in subsequent years to build up a base of knowledge and expertise.'
  structure: 'The program provides a one-year renewable fellowship with an expectation of 15 hours of work per week; fellows meet weekly to gain skills and discuss projects.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'The experimental nature of the program means that it is highly flexible, but also means that frequent evaluation and possible course-correction may be needed.'

## UCL DH
ucldh:
  mission: 'To equip students to work on problems that are interesting and challenging scholarship—both from a humanities perspective and from a computer science/engineering perspective.'
  people: 'This master’s-level program is highly interdisciplinary; students enter with a range of backgrounds and participate in modules across the faculties. The program is directed by <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dis/people/simonmahony">Simon Mahony</a>, with input from all of the UCLDH team.'
  research: 'Because the modules are brief and varied, students build a body of knowledge rather than focusing on a single project. As a whole, the Centre produces <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects">an impressive range of intellectually rich work products.</a>'
  support: 'While initial funding for the program has been provided by the university, the Centre for Digital Humanities—including the MA/MSc program—is now self-sustaining through student fees and research grants.'
  directions: 'As the program progresses, it will expand collaboration to include a broader range of faculty and students while sustaining high enrollment.'
  structure: 'Depending on background and goals, students work towards an MA or MSc degree during three terms of study. The first two terms consist of taught modules, while the third focuses on coursework, exams, and work placement. The remainder of the year is spent on an independent research project or dissertation.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'As in any program that works across multiple departments and schools, it is critical to ensure that expectations for participation are clear from the outset.'

## Duke PhD Lab
duke-phd-lab:
  mission: 'To provide an arena in which PhD students in the humanities and interpretive social sciences can learn about new digital scholarship, engage with its challenges, and see its promise for their own research and professional lives within or outside the university.'
  people: 'Director <a href="http://romancestudies.duke.edu/people?subpage=profile&Gurl=%2Faas%2FRomance&Uil=dfbell">David F. Bell</a> brings together a diverse cohort of approximately twelve PhD and MFA students from disciplines across the arts, humanities, and interpretive social sciences.'
  research: 'The capstone project for participating scholars is an e-portfolio that integrates approaches the students have learned about online self-presentation and more specific thematic topics, such as peer-to-peer teaching. Scholars also develop collaborative projects.'
  support: 'The program operates on internal funding provided by Trinity College of Arts and Sciences, Duke Graduate School, and the Franklin Humanities Institute.'
  directions: 'With a mission that is largely student-driven, this experimental program will change according to student needs and feedback. While students do not receive funding, several teaching assistantships may be available to participating students in future years.'
  structure: 'The one-year renewable program includes courses, workshops, and public events centered around two or three overarching topics; scholars meet informally every two weeks as they work toward the development of an e-portfolio, which they present to one another at the end of the year.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'A program that is as flexible and experimental as this requires a good deal of institutional understanding in order for the program to evolve according to student needs.'

## Brock IASC
brock-iasc:
  mission: 'To combine theory and practice so that students can study how and why new media are emerging, as well as create their own integrative digital media projects.'
  people: 'Under the direction of <a href="http://www.brocku.ca/humanities/departments-and-centres/history/faculty-staff/kevin-kee">Kevin Kee</a>, the program includes a number of core faculty members and cohorts of approximately 25 undergraduates pursuing majors or minors.'
  research: 'Alongside their studies, many students participate in public projects, such as the <a href="http://ihistorytours.com/">Niagara 1812</a> historical project, which allows them to apply the skills they learn to projects with immediate public relevance.'
  support: 'As an academic program within Brock’s system, IASC has a hard budget line and is not supported by grants. At the same time, some of the program’s research activities are funded through a separate research allocation.'
  directions: 'The program may undergo a number of structural changes in the coming years, including launching a new stream specifically for game studies, in order to serve student needs as the program continues to evolve.'
  structure: 'Students take a few core courses, and then craft their own cross-disciplinary path based on their interests. Many students also participate in internships at companies based at <a href="http://ngen-niagara.com/en/content/welcome/index/">nGen</a>, an area business incubator that partners with IASC.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'Though it can be challenging, creating relationships across the university and the broader community opens up valuable opportunities and amplifies the strengths of each partner.'

## University of Canterbury Digital Humanities
ucdh:
  mission: 'To create Digital Humanities pathways from undergraduate and graduate study to work-based internships, offering students the opportunity to apply their skills in real-world contexts while also increasing digital capabilities across the humanities and social sciences.'
  people: 'Students from a wide range of fields in the humanities and social sciences participate in various aspects of the program, from jointly-taught courses, to internships, to honors degrees and thesis work. The program is directed by James Smithies.'
  research: 'The core of the program is a year-long Honours degree blending the student’s home discipline with digital humanities methods. UCDH is also developing non-degree programs for undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral students wishing to incorporate digital approaches into their work.'
  support: 'While the program is still too new to have many completed research projects, students have already been deeply involved in the development of the <a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/">UC CEISMIC Archive</a> and <a href="https://quakestudies.canterbury.ac.nz/">UC QuakeStudies Repository</a>.'
  directions: 'Support for the program is provided internally by the university, and is based on student enrollment.'
  structure: 'The basic model is in place and working well. The team is now focused on building out existing pathways, identifying new businesses in need of student interns, and helping develop the approach across all arts, humanities and social science disciplines.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'Interdisciplinarity and collaboration are the keys to the University of Canterbury approach.'
