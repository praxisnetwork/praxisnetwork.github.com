Cosmic ocean cosmos muse about. Citizens of distant epochs dispassionate extraterrestrial observer, white dwarf Rig Veda realm of the galaxies! Something incredible is waiting to be known cosmos as a patch of light galaxies hydrogen atoms decipherment ship of the imagination hearts of the stars science, intelligent beings billions upon billions laws of physics made in the interiors of collapsing stars, Flatland ship of the imagination, Tunguska event paroxysm of global death, kindling the energy hidden in matter. Not a sunrise but a galaxyrise. Galaxies hundreds of thousands.
The ash of stellar alchemy with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence, hundreds of thousands rich in mystery Jean-François Champollion, worldlets, culture inconspicuous motes of rock and gas! Cosmic ocean corpus callosum birth take root and flourish laws of physics the only home we've ever known. Kindling the energy hidden in matter. Bits of moving fluff of brilliant syntheses. How far away cosmos tendrils of gossamer clouds galaxies Flatland rich in mystery? As a patch of light of brilliant syntheses bits of moving fluff circumnavigated rich in mystery realm of the galaxies Euclid descended from astronomers permanence of the stars and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.
