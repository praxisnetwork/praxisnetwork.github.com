<h1>About</h1>

<p>The Praxis Network was developed as part of the Scholarly Communication Institute's 2012-2013 work stream on rethinking graduate education, which aspires to think through the important new literacies of humanities disciplines, the post-graduate career opportunities for students, and the best ways of providing methodological training and research support in light of both disciplinary and post-graduate needs. It complements a survey of perceptions of career preparation among humanities graduate students and their employers, as well as a series of meetings that SCI is convening in partnership with the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI) and centerNet, an international network of digital humanities centers.</p>
<p>Each of the programs featured here was developed independently in an ecosystem that includes a wide range of factors: disciplinary expectations, institutional needs, resource opportunities, and so on. Each has also confronted a unique set of challenges. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all the possibilities for innovating methodological training—far from it. Rather, these programs represent some of the patterns and idiosyncrasies new programs with similar goals are likely to face. </p>
<p>As you explore the site, we hope that you will notice aspects of each program that are similar to your home institution, and other elements that are distinct. By sharing information publicly, the people and programs involved hope to make it easier for others who may wish to establish similar programs to establish good practices and to navigate common challenges.</p>
