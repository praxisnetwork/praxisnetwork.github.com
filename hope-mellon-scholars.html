<h2>Mission</h2>

<div class="content">
<p>Launched in 2010, the Mellon Scholars program at Hope College has three interrelated goals: to encourage deep collaboration between humanities students and faculty; to highlight student achievement to a broader public; and to build institutional engagement in the digital humanities. The program works with students over multiple semesters to lead the students into progressively closer collaboration with faculty, deep research engagement, and public communication of that research.

<h2>People</h2>

<div class="content">
<p>The Mellon Scholars Program involves a larger number of people than many of the other programs featured on the network, which suggests the possibility of a broader reach within the institution. Each year, a cohort of 17-20 exceptional students are selected by a committee following a rigorous application process; at full-capacity, the program should include about 50 students. The program has a strong focus on interdisciplinarity, so the seminars that take place during the first two semesters of study are taught by rotating faculty members representing a wide range of departments in the Arts and Humanities division. In the second year of study, students work one-on-one or in small groups with a faculty member in an Oxford-style tutorial or team-based projects, among other options.

<p>The program is directed by William Pannapacker, Associate Professor of English. His research and teaching interests include American literature and culture, Digital Humanities, environmental writing, auto/biography, and Walt Whitman. Pannapacker is also a columnist for the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em> and a contributor to <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>Slate</em>, where he writes about a range of issues related to higher education in the humanities.

<h2>Structure</h2>

<div class="content">
<p>The Mellon Scholars Program recruits first- and second-year students for a two-semester seminar on scholarly research and writing, collaboration, presentation, grant-writing, and digital skills.  For their remaining credits, students select from a variety of options including: intensified upper-division courses with individual mentoring and substantial research expectations; faculty-led, team-based, cross-cohort digital projects (e.g.,“Digital Holland, Michigan”); faculty-mentored, individual capstone projects, some of which are funded summer fellowships; technology courses (e.g., “Web Design”); off-campus research experiences (Newberry Library Program); summer internships in the digital humanities (the MATRIX Center at Michigan State); and internships supported by coursework in the digital humanities at the Philadelphia Center (“DH in the Workplace”).</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.hope-mellon-scholars.research }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>In most cases, the culminating year of the Mellon Scholars Program leads to the creation of a capstone project. There are wide-ranging possibilities for the specific nature of the project; one common feature is that the projects are intended to be something beyond a paper that can be presented in a public environment, typically at the college’s <a href="http://celebration.hope.edu/">Celebration of Undergraduate Research and Creative Performance</a> and national undergraduate conferences such as <a href="http://www.cur.org/ncur_2013/">NCUR</a> and <a href="http://www.cur.org/conferences_and_events/student_events/posters_on_the_hill/">Posters on the Hill</a>.
</p>
<p>A glance at the project abstracts reveals the scope of the disciplines subject matters. The final community presentation element provides students with the important practice of communicating about their research to non-specialists—something that is not commonly done in undergraduate humanities programs.

<h2>Support</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.hope-mellon-scholars.support }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>The program was developed thanks to a $200,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and is further supported by internal funding to support faculty development.  The grant will cover the first five years of the program’s development; beyond that, funding for subsequent years will require additional grants or stronger support from within the institution.

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.hope-mellon-scholars.directions }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>As the program solidifies, Pannapacker hopes that it will attract an increasing number of applicants, allowing the quality of participants and their research to continue to advance. The program depends on the investment of faculty time and expertise, so Pannapacker also hopes that faculty will continue to see the value of the program and become more deeply engaged with it.As student projects grow more sophisticated, the program might also require faculty to advance their own skills and training so that they can continue to provide high-quality mentorship to their students. One benefit as the program grows more mature is that past scholars will become a resource for subsequent classes; some funding is available for students to return in a mentorship capacity.
</p>
<p>Because the program is grant funded, its continued development is dependent upon a longer-term funding solution. While not in immediate need of new support, over the next few years it will be important that the program either secures additional grant funding or obtains support from the institution itself.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.hope-mellon-scholars.implementation }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>Because the program has such a long duration, there are some particular factors to keep in mind if you’re considering implementing something similar. First, it may be difficult for students to gauge their own willingness to participate over the long term; though they begin with enthusiasm, attrition has been significant. This can be alleviated in part by making guidelines and expectations as clear as possible, increasing the program’s options and flexibility, and by providing ample mentorship for students, especially if they begin to struggle. Undergraduates typically have limited research experience when they begin, so the program represents a significant range of new skills and approaches.
</p>
<p>
As with other programs featured in the Praxis Network, the involvement of many different departments and disciplines has clear advantages as well as potential challenges.  The Program has had to prepare in advance for varied expectations, methodological assumptions, and comfort levels with digital technologies—both on the part of students and faculty. If possible, the program seeks to engage with other institutions to share expertise and guidance.</p>
