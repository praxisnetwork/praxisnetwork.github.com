<h1 class="intro">equipping students for forward-looking scholarship &amp; meaningful humanities careers</span></h1>

<div class="content">
<p>Praxis Network programs are allied but differently-inflected humanities education initiatives, mainly focused on graduate training, and all engaged in rethinking pedagogy and campus partnerships in relation to the digital. Among other elements, the initiatives emphasize new models of methodological training and collaborative research. Each program exists within a particular ecosystem of disciplinary expectations, institutional needs, available resources, leadership styles, and specific challenges.</p>
<p><a href="/compare/">Compare</a> the Praxis Network programs across several categories. The <a href="/institutions/">Directory of Related Programs</a> showcases efforts in the digital humanities, arts, and culture.</p>

<p>Have something to add? Check out this <a href="/dh2018">CFP</a> for a proposed roundtable to take place at DH 2018. Submissions due October 1st.</p>
<p>NB: a number of the initiatives listed here have changed in the years since they were catalogued, either in structure or in staffing. Rather than consider the site as an up-to-date registry, we would encourage you instead to consider it a historical snapshot. To get current information and contacts, interested readers should peruse the webpages for the programs themselves.</p>
