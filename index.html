<h1 class="intro">new models of methodological training &amp; collaborative research || equipping students for forward-looking scholarship &amp; meaningful humanities careers</span></h1>

<div class="content">
<p>Praxis Network programs are allied but differently-inflected humanities training initiatives, most focused on graduate education, and all engaged in rethinking pedagogy and partnerships in relation to the digital. Each program exists within a particular ecosystem of disciplinary expectations, institutional needs, available resources, leadership styles, and specific challenges.</p> 
<p>Scroll down to see how these emerging models compare across a number of categories, or select a single program to read an in-depth profile. </p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This informal network was developed with support from the <a href="http://mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a> as part of a 2012-2013 <a href="http://uvasci.org">Scholarly Communication Institute</a> (SCI) project on rethinking graduate education. Its goal is to highlight emerging literacies necessary to humanities scholarship in the digital age, and to offer model program that expand career opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. Related SCI work includes a <a href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/who-we-are">study of alt-ac career preparation</a> as well as a <a href="http://uvasci.org/current-work/graduate-education/">series of meetings</a> convened in partnership with <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/">centerNet</a> and <a href="http://chcinetwork.org/">CHCI</a>, the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes.</p>
