    <!--<Can we automatically include the text from each category page as the first sentence of each section? I don't know yet what order will be best. Also, it would be nice to have the background of each program's page be a photo specifically related to that institution.-->
	<h2>Mission</h2>
<p><!--Intro sentence from relevant category page--> The Praxis Program produces humanities scholars who are as comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets. Started in 2011 as a pilot program at the Scholars' Lab at the University of Virginia, Praxis is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars' Lab, and is is meant to complement our work with Graduate Fellows in Digital Humanities, a program shortly entering its sixth year at UVa Library.</p>
<p>I'll also add a little more here about the relationships between SCI, Praxis, SLab, etc.</p>
	<h2>People</h2>
<p><!--Intro sentence from relevant category page-->Bethany Nowviskie is Director of Digital Research & Scholarship at the University of Virginia Library and President of the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH). She holds a doctorate in English from the University of Virginia and has taught courses in writing, poetry, bibliography, and new media aesthetics and design. Nowviskie has been a practicing digital humanist since the mid-1990s.</p>

<p>Nowviskie’s work at the University of Virginia Library includes oversight of the Scholars’ Lab, which combines the services and resources of UVA’s former Etext, GeoStat, and Research Computing Support Centers. The Scholars’ Lab hosts public programs on the impact of new media and methods on scholarship, and also sponsors a graduate fellowship and a new Praxis Program for hands-on methodological training in the digital humanities. Nowviskie additionally manages a “Digital Scholarship R&D” unit, providing consultation, programming support, and infrastructure for innovative work in the humanities and social sciences.</p>

<p>Nowviskie also serves on the steering committees of centerNet, MediaCommons, and the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO), and chairs the MLA‘s Committee on Information Technology. Her own research interests lie in the intersection of algorithmic or procedural method and traditional humanities interpretation. She is currently working on a scholarly edition of A.C. Swinburne’s 1866 Poems and Ballads, and on two small creatures under the age of eight.</p>

<p><!--I'll shorten Bethany's bio a bit and add more info about the R&D team and the fellows, so maybe add two paragraphs of lorem ipsum for length.-->

	<h2>Support</h2>
<p><!--Intro sentence from relevant category page-->Ongoing funding is still up in the air, which makes sustainability a concern, but one that Nowviskie is committed to resolving. The Praxis Program is one piece of a much larger ecosystem of digital initiatives at the University of Virginia, and is quickly becoming an integral and valuable part of the contribution that the Scholars' Lab is making to the humanities -- not only because of the tool they are developing, as great as it is, but also because of the model for innovative methodological training that they provide.</p>

	<h2>Structure</h2>
<p><!--Intro sentence from relevant category page--> The first meetings in the semester are exploratory and instructional: while the fellows think about and discuss the directions that they'd like the tool to take, they also receive practical tech-based lessons from the R&D staff on topics like the command line, coding, using GitHub, and more. Tech skills are one side of the equation, but just as important is the evolution of a coherent team structure. The cohort begins by drafting a charter with guiding principles for credit, conflict resolution, and more. As time goes on, they sort themselves into specific roles: project managers, coders, designers -- the same kinds of roles that you would find in any real-world development team. As a result, not only are they learning something and making something, they're also gaining crucial workplace skills that are typically not found in academic humanities departments.</p>
<p>More information here about the kinds of lessons, day-to-day interactions, project planning, blogging, etc. </p>
	<h2>Research</h2>
<p><!--Intro sentence from relevant category page--></p>
<p>Beyond Prism, our fellows are also producing exciting projects of their own, as is the Scholars' Lab research and development team. In fact, one of the key components of  all Scholars' Lab staff staff time is an allowance of 20% of that time for their own research and development work. This time ensures that the team members advance in their own scholarship and maintain their own portfolio of new and engaging work -- and frequently, the projects evolve into projects that the team takes on together. (Neatline is one example of this.)</p> 
<p>We invite you to follow our work together (always in progress), as we see what it takes to produce thoughtful digital humanities scholars — scholars comfortable designing effective user experiences, writing and working with open source code, engaging broad audiences, managing teams and budgets, and theorizing their work within the rich tradition of humanities computing.</p>
	<h2>Directions</h2>
<p><!--Intro sentence from relevant category page-->The program functions best with a small cohort, so the goal won't be to grow to an enormous size. Rather, a measure of success will be continued funding and internal sustainability; an increasing applicant pool; fellows from an ever-wider range of disciplines; and the successful continuation of past fellows through their graduate programs and into the careers of their choosing. Already, the two fellows from the first cohort who finished their degrees have been hired to do work that excites them, and both credit the Praxis Program as significant affecting their employment opportunities and decisions.</p>
