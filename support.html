    <p>Funding and support are crucial considerations for any emerging program. Each program featured here works within a unique model of support -- some relying on grant money, others functioning as a fixed budget line within a department, and others that bring together pockets of funding from various sources.</p>

          <td>While initial funding for the program has been provided by the university, the program expects to become self-sustaining through student fees and research grants.</td>
